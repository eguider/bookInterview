- <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">Question</span> : log request response, add correlation id in the http header (uuid) and add it to all log lines
- <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">Response</span> : Added @RequestHeader("correlation_id") in every end point in the controller, then passed the uuid to the log statement, you can test it by going to the headers section in postman, add a header with the key correlation_id and a value, then send a request (and I added a log file where spring can write the logs, it's called bookManagement.log)
- <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">Question</span> : dockerize the jar
- <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">Response</span> : Added the Dockerfile necessary to run the application in a dockerized environment, run gradle build to generate the jar, then run "docker build --tag=book-management:latest ." to build the image and "docker run -p8080:8080 book-management:latest" to run the container
- <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">Question</span> : simulate cache system, like what we have done with repository, create a cache service and cache the added book for 1 min
- <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">Response</span> : Check the BookSimulatedCacheService and how it is used when injected into the BookService
- <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">Question</span> : redis docker and use it in local to cache teh books for 1 min
- <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">Response</span> : Added The Spring Boot Data Redis Dependency with the necessary information in application properties and configuration in configuration/RedisConfig to connect to the local instance of redis, the local instance of redis in run using docker-compose, and it also runs a redis insight instance that works as a GUI to easily manipulate redis, as a result the getBook by id method in the controller is cached and the key used in the cache is the id, and the value is cached for 1 minute
- <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">Question</span> : use actuator to expose prometheus metrics (stretch goal use dockerized prometheus to scrape the metrics)
- <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">Response</span> : added the actuator and prometheus dependency in build.gradle file to expose the /metrics/prometheus end point, then created the docker-compose file to run an instance of prometheus that uses the ./prometheus/prometheus.yml file to connect to spring boot (if you want to test it change the ip address in the prometheus.yml file to your machine's ip address,go to localhost:9090 then go to status/targets, and you will find that the spring boot application target is connected and its status is UP)
- <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">Question</span> : mysqldb docker (optional)
